# My Event Management Platform Showcase 

Welcome to the showcase of my Event Management Platform project! This project was a part of an internship assessment where I demonstrated my web development skills. The platform enables users to browse upcoming events, book tickets, and manage bookings, while administrators have access to an admin dashboard for event management.

## Features
- **Event Listing and Details:** Implemented a feature to display upcoming events with essential details such as title, date, location, and ticket availability.
- **Booking Tickets:** Enabled users to select the number of tickets they wish to book for an event and implemented a simple booking process.
- **User Dashboard:** Developed a user dashboard where users can view their booked events and cancel bookings if needed.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Created a separate admin dashboard accessible only to company administrators. Admins can manage events, create new events, edit event details, and delete events. Additionally, admins can view all bookings and manage them (e.g., cancel bookings, view attendee details).
- **Basic Styling and UI/UX:** Applied a simple and clean design using Tailwind CSS for a consistent look and feel. Focused on usability and intuitive navigation to enhance the user experience.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Implemented basic error handling and validation for user inputs (e.g., form submissions) and provided informative error messages to guide users in case of invalid actions.

## Tech Stack
This project was built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack additional with Vite and Typescript.
